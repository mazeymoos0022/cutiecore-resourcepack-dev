# Resource Pack 
This is the custom resource pack for Cutiecord, created by [MazeyMoos0022](https://github.mazeymoos.com/)

## Test the resource pack.

If you have not cloned this repo into your resources folder for minecraft, I advise moving it there first.

1. Launch the game
2. Enter a local/singleplayer testing world.
3. Zip the file up and test

If everything worked you should now have your item.

# Building the Bundle

To build the bundle just run the **bundle.sh**. The update the `server.properities` file for the server to link the new zip file update the hash value for the zip.
